## [about the] Config vars
1. We are currently using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication & all, and [Slash GraphQL](https://auth0.com/) as our backend-less backend (sounds cool, right? Check it out [here](https://slash.dgraph.io/))
2. All the configs related to the Slash GraphQL and Auth0 can be found inside the ```src/configs.js```
